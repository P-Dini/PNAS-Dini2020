**Description:**

- WSG_processing.md and RNAseq_processing.md include the steps to be run in command line for quality check, trimming, mapping, and sorting of raw reads.

*customized_java* contains all java scripts prepared for running all analyses. These analyses include:

- Identifying SNPs from RNA-seq data.
- Assign parent-of-origin to the identified SNPs.
- Annotate found methylated cytosines from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).
